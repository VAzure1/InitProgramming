## History of computing and Programming 

### Which one came first,computing or programming??

Programming existed before the computer was invented.Programming is all about agreeing on certain conventions to achieve our objective.So right before the computer was invented people agreed on certain conventions.As an example we can see stylesheets used by writers and publishers.These stylesheets led to the creation of the cascade style sheet(CSS). Therefore, conventions that were used before computer are the things that led to computer programming. Therefore computing is all about processing the text(code) written by human beings and storing them inorder to pass knowledge from generations to generations.
