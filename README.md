## History of computing and Programming 

### Which one came first,computing or programming??
Before the creation of the computer, programming already existed. To accomplish our goal, we must all agree on certain practices while programming. People established some traditions before the invention of the computer. We can observe how authors and publishers utilize stylesheets as an illustration. The cascade style sheet was developed as a result of these stylesheets (CSS). Conventions from before the invention of computers are what ultimately gave rise to computer programming. Thus, processing human-written language (code) and storing it in order to transmit information from one generation to the next is the essence of computers.
### <em>How the Name computer is given </em>

The Latin term "computare," which means <emphasize>"to calculate</emphasize>, to count, to total up, or to think together," is the root of the English word "computer." Therefore, a "device that does computing" is what the term "computer" actually implies.

#### Relationship between programming and texts

Text is not used to store all files on a computer. Text, on the other hand, is one of the simplest things to save in files. My view is that early programming languages were written in text since it is so easy to put in files. Nothing else made sense to represent high-level programs at the time. (Of course, there is byte code, but we need something human-readable.
